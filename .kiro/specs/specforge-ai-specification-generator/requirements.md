# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SpecForge is an AI-powered web application that simulates an Agile team conversation to generate professional software specifications. The application allows users to input app ideas in plain language and receive structured, professional specifications through conversations with AI personas representing different roles (Product Manager, Tech Lead, UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, Scrum Master). The output consists of three Kiro-compatible markdown files: requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to describe my app idea and get professional specifications, so that I can start building immediately without extensive planning overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs an app idea description THEN the system SHALL initiate a conversation with AI personas
2. WHEN the conversation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate three markdown files (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
3. WHEN specifications are generated THEN they SHALL be immediately usable in Kiro IDE without modification
4. WHEN a user completes the specification process THEN it SHALL take no more than 30 minutes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want AI experts to challenge my assumptions and ask clarifying questions, so that I create more robust and well-thought-out specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI persona identifies unclear requirements THEN it SHALL ask specific clarifying questions
2. WHEN multiple AI personas have different perspectives THEN they SHALL engage in collaborative discussion
3. WHEN business assumptions are made THEN the Product Manager persona SHALL challenge and validate them
4. WHEN technical constraints conflict with business goals THEN AI personas SHALL work together to find solutions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a startup founder, I want to understand technical complexity and development tasks, so that I can better plan resources and timelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technical complexity is discussed THEN the Tech Lead persona SHALL provide clear explanations
2. WHEN development tasks are generated THEN they SHALL include effort estimates and dependencies
3. WHEN architecture decisions are made THEN they SHALL include rationale and trade-offs
4. WHEN the tasks.md file is generated THEN it SHALL contain sprint/milestone organization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a development team, I want consistent, detailed specs in a standard format, so that we can integrate with tools like Kiro IDE seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifications are generated THEN they SHALL follow Kiro IDE compatible formatting
2. WHEN markdown files are created THEN they SHALL contain all required sections
3. WHEN files are downloaded THEN they SHALL be properly structured with consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN specifications are validated THEN 95% SHALL contain all required sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with multiple AI personas in a natural chat interface, so that I feel like I'm having a real team discussion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN it SHALL display a clean, modern UI similar to ChatGPT/Claude
2. WHEN AI personas respond THEN they SHALL show typing indicators and smooth animations
3. WHEN conversations occur THEN message history SHALL be maintained and accessible
4. WHEN multiple personas participate THEN each SHALL have distinct personalities and expertise areas
5. WHEN personas interact THEN they SHALL reference each other's contributions naturally

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview and download my generated specifications, so that I can review them before using them in my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifications are generated THEN the system SHALL provide a preview mode
2. WHEN previewing specs THEN users SHALL be able to view each markdown file separately
3. WHEN downloading THEN users SHALL have options for individual files or ZIP archive
4. WHEN files are generated THEN they SHALL be available for immediate download
5. WHEN copying content THEN users SHALL be able to copy individual file contents

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle concurrent users reliably, so that the service remains available during peak usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 100+ concurrent conversations are active THEN the system SHALL maintain performance
2. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement graceful throttling
3. WHEN AI API failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without data loss

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history saved, so that I can return to previous specifications or continue interrupted sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation starts THEN the system SHALL create a persistent session
2. WHEN users return to the application THEN they SHALL be able to access previous conversations
3. WHEN conversations are interrupted THEN users SHALL be able to resume from the last message
4. WHEN specifications are generated THEN they SHALL be linked to the originating conversation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI team to follow a structured conversation flow, so that all important aspects of my application are covered systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation begins THEN the Product Manager SHALL initiate with business-focused questions
2. WHEN business requirements are established THEN the Tech Lead SHALL discuss technical architecture
3. WHEN technical approach is defined THEN the UX Designer SHALL address user experience concerns
4. WHEN core functionality is planned THEN the DevOps Engineer SHALL consider deployment and infrastructure
5. WHEN all aspects are covered THEN the Scrum Master SHALL organize tasks and estimate effort
6. WHEN conflicts arise between personas THEN they SHALL engage in resolution discussions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated tasks to be actionable and well-organized, so that I can immediately begin implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are generated THEN they SHALL be categorized by type (Frontend, Backend, Integration, Testing, Deployment)
2. WHEN each task is created THEN it SHALL include ID, title, description, priority, dependencies, and effort estimate
3. WHEN tasks are organized THEN they SHALL be grouped into logical sprints or milestones
4. WHEN task dependencies exist THEN they SHALL be clearly identified and documented
5. WHEN definition of done is needed THEN each task category SHALL include completion criteria
